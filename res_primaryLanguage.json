I made the leap to software development when I saw the need to improve the company I used to work for way of communicating, progress tracking, and job assigning with technology instead of pencil and paper. I then joined Epicodus Web and Mobile Developement Program in May 2021 and have been on my journey to become a Full-Stack Software Developer ever since.",
